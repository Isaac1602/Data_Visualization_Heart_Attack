# Data Visualization Heart Attack

This repository showcases an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project aimed at predicting heart disease using a dataset of patient health metrics. Key steps include:

- Data preprocessing: Handling missing values and duplicates
- Feature analysis: Exploring health factors like cholesterol, blood pressure, and age
- Visualization: Using Seaborn and Matplotlib to identify trends and correlations
- Predictive modeling: Developing machine learning models for heart disease prediction.
- Tools: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
